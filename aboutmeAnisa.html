    <h4>Hello! Nice to meet you. I am a rising senior at McNair Academic High School willing to pursue a career in biological science. I have much experience in the field of research. So far, I have won several awards for executing independent studies/experiments in microbiology, materials science, and mechanical/theoretical engineering (two bronze medals and one gold). I am the class president of my class, a founder of Hope for Youth in Foster Care (HYFC) - a youth-led initiative/organization advocating for the increase in resources for foster children in NJ schools, and a member of the National Honors Society. I am also recognized as a New Jersey Governor's STEM Scholar and got to participate in a research project at New Jersey City University where I studied the mechanisms of the NLRP3 inflammasome needed to induce pyroptosis. During the summer of my sophomore year, I worked for the Jersey City Department of Housing, Economic Development & Commerce as a youth assistant and attained more skills in Microsoft Excel. I look forward to connecting and networking with more people that share similar interests. </h4>
